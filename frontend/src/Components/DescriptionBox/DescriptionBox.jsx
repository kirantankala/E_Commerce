        An e-commerce website is an online platform that enables the buying and selling of products or services over the internet. It acts as a virtual marketplace where businesses and individuals can display their products, engage with customers, and conduct transactions without needing a physical storefront. The popularity of e-commerce websites has surged due to their convenience, accessibility, and global reach.

          E-commerce websites typically display products or services along with
          detailed descriptions, images, prices, and any available variations
          (e.g., sizes, colors). Each product usually has its own dedicated page
          with relevant information.
